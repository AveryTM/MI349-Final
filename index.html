          My daughter Cidney (21 months) has been with Michelle for a year in full-time daycare. Michelle is very loving and nurturing. My daughter has developed beyond expectations this past year and Michelle has played a big role in that accomplishment. My daughter looks forward to spending time at Michelle's home during the week. I can definitely tell that my daughter feels safe and secure in Michelle's home. Michelle has exceeded my expectations and I am very heppy that I selected Michelle as my daycare provider.

          Michelle runs a very organized, professional, loving daycare. Not only does she take very good care of your children but educates them thru play. Having fun and being educated at the same time are pluses in any daycare. I recommend to everyone that needs daycare for their children from infant to school age.
